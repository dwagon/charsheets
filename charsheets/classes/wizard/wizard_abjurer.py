    Vulnerabilities, apply them before reducing the ward’s Hit Points. If the damage reduces the ward to 0 Hit 
    Points, you take any remaining damage. While the ward has O Hit Points, it can’t absorb damage, but its magic 
    remains.

    the level of the spell slot. Alternatively, as a Bonus Action, you can expend a spell slot, and the ward
